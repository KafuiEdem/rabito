## SIMPLE CALCULATOR

This is a small calculator APP created in Python using the PyScript framework.
The APP can perform the following arithmetic calculations:

+ Addition
+ Subtraction
+ Division
+ Multiplication

The APP checks if you have entered a digit and performs the calculation for you. If you enter anything apart from a number, it throws a `Math Error.`

Currently, the APP does not work with decimals.
